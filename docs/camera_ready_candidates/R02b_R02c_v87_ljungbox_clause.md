**Why this is not applied now.** The manuscript is under review and cannot be edited. The KDD 2027 Research Track allocates one additional content page to accepted papers for exactly this kind of revision, so budget is not the constraint; timing is. Applying a correction before the deviation inventory is complete guarantees reapplying it later.

**What is being corrected.** Not the published number: 11 rejections out of 120 is an ordinary draw under a true rate of 5.8% (probability 8.9%). What is corrected is the subordinate clause asserting a mechanism that is wrong independently of any sample.

and already over-reject on the i.i.d.\ arm ($9.2\%$), where $t_7$ innovations deprive $\varepsilon_t^2$ of a fourth moment and the $\chi^2$ approximation fails;

and reject at $9.2\%$ on the i.i.d.\ arm, a rate that $120$ streams cannot separate from nominal; a dedicated sweep ($1{,}000$ streams per point, horizons to $n = 1.28\times10^5$) places $t_7$ at nominal and the over-rejection beyond the sixth-moment boundary ($7.7\%$ at $\nu \le 6$, excluding nominal at every horizon), a boundary we locate without identifying its cause: $\varepsilon_t^2$ has a finite variance throughout ($\nu > 4$), which is what the limit requires, and an infinite fourth ($\nu \le 8$) at $\nu = 7$ as well;
