# Camera-ready candidate — NO DEVIATION, clarification only: a third of the persistence collapse is a corner solution at the optimiser's bound

**Why this is not applied now.** The manuscript is under review and cannot be edited.

**Nothing here is false.** The persistence does collapse from 0.85 to 0.62 at $n=250$, exactly as L341 states. However, the text attributes the collapse entirely 
to finite-sample estimation variance. The per-fit measurement shows that 29% of the fits at that cell sit exactly on the optimiser's lower bound (`1e-6`, essentially 
zero persistence, no GARCH at all). The collapse is therefore significantly driven by a corner solution of the optimiser.

## Edit — `sec:misspecification` L341, specify the mechanism

**Verification of the search string.** Quoted from `articleB_whitening_v87.tex` **line 341** verbatim; `grep -Fc` returns `1`.
