**Why this is not applied now.** The manuscript is under review and cannot be edited. The deviation inventory is not closed: streams after R11 may touch the same figure, and applying a correction before the inventory closes guarantees reapplying it later.

**What is being corrected.** A caption, not a claim. Figure 11 carries two panels produced by two different calls of the submitted script, at two different drift magnitudes and two different sample sizes, and the caption states only the first pair:

| Panel | Produced by                                             | drift `c` | streams per point |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| **A** | `run_experiment_d(n_seeds=1000, ...)`, `Delta = 2.0*σ`  | **2.0**   | **1,000**         |
| **B** | `run_experiment_b(n_seeds=5000, ...)`, `c = 1.5` passed | **1.5**   | **5,000**         |

`plot_figure_20(df_d, df_b)` is called with those two frames at `Priorite_12_multi_detector.py:613`; `df_b` is the return value of `run_experiment_b`, whose `tasks_h1` are built with the literal `1.5` at line 337, and whose `n_seeds` is `args.n_seeds_b`, defaulting to 5000 at line 592. `df_d` comes from `run_experiment_d(n_seeds=1000, ...)` at line 609, with `Delta = 2.0 * sigma_unc` at line 451.

**The manuscript corroborates the correction twice, in its own text.** The body sentence that Figure 11B illustrates says the delays are measured "under a physical shift ($c=1.5$)", and the caption of Figure 15 says "Universality of the whitening filter ($c=1.5$)" for the same Concept campaign. Only the Figure 11 caption carries `c=2` across both panels.

**The claim the caption supports is unaffected.** "Whitened Concept: flat delays for all detectors" is a statement about panel B, and panel B is the `c=1.5`, 5,000-stream campaign throughout. What the caption misstates is the parameters a reader would use to reproduce it.

**Verification of the search string.** The block below is quoted from `articleB_whitening_v87.tex` line 575 verbatim and occurs exactly once in the file. Verify once more before applying, as a matter of routine.

**A second, independent edit is deliberately not bundled here.** The same figure's panel A and panel B use two different ADWIN implementations under one legend entry — a local prefix-sum window detector on the `Data` statistic (`delta = 5e-4`, `min_window = 30`) and river's ADWIN on the `Concept` stream (`delta = 0.002`). That is a separate question about what the figure compares, not about what its caption says, and it is treated in `R11_v87_detector_comparability.md`.
