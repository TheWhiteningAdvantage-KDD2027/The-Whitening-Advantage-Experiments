# Camera-ready candidate — NO DEVIATION, clarification only: "restored from n = 500 onward" is stated without conditioning on the leverage, and rests on an interval rather than on a point

**Why this is not applied now.** The manuscript is under review and cannot be edited.

**Nothing here is false.** The sentence is true as written under the falsification rule preamble §S3 fixes for a printed level: a bound is crossed only when the 95 % interval of the regenerated value excludes it, and at `n = 500` the interval covers the nominal `5 %` on **both** leverage settings, in the submitted campaign and in the regenerated one alike. What the sentence omits is that `protocol_3d` runs **two** columns and that the restoration is read on one of them.

**The two columns, in both campaigns.** `protocol_3d` sweeps `n_warmup ∈ {250, 500, 1000, 2000}` against `gamma_lev ∈ {0.00, 0.28}` at 200 streams per cell. L341 quotes one pair of cells.

| `n_warmup` | witness `γ_lev = 0.00` | witness `γ_lev = 0.28` | regenerated `γ_lev = 0.00` | regenerated `γ_lev = 0.28` |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `250`      | `9.5 %`                | `11.5 %`               | `10.5 %`  `[7.0, 15.5]`    | `10.0 %`  `[6.6, 14.9]`    |
| `500`      | `3.0 %`                | **`6.0 %`**            | **`7.0 %`**  `[4.2, 11.4]` | **`7.5 %`**  `[4.6, 12.0]` |
| `1000`     | `3.0 %`                | `4.5 %`                | `3.5 %`  `[1.7, 7.0]`      | `4.0 %`  `[2.0, 7.7]`      |
| `2000`     | `3.0 %`                | `3.5 %`                | `2.0 %`  `[0.8, 5.0]`      | `2.0 %`  `[0.8, 5.0]`      |

Intervals are Wilson score intervals at 200 streams, the delivered `wilson_ci` with `z = 1.96`.

**What the two campaigns agree on, and what only the regenerated one shows.** Both agree that the rate falls monotonically with the warm-up on both columns, with no inversion beyond two paired standard errors, and that the `n = 500` cell covers the nominal level on both columns. The submitted campaign shows the restoration as a **point** at `3.0 %` on the symmetric column and as `6.0 %` on the leverage column, which is where the asymmetry the sentence does not mention is visible; the 128-bit re-keying moves the symmetric column to `7.0 %`, so in the regenerated campaign the two columns sit within half a point of each other at `n = 500` and neither is at the nominal level. The asymmetry is therefore a feature of the submitted draw, and what survives both draws is the weaker and more defensible statement: **at `n = 500` the interval covers the level; the point estimate does not sit on it.**

## Edit — `sec:misspecification` L341, name the column and the basis

**Verification of the search string.** Quoted from `articleB_whitening_v87.tex` **line 341** verbatim; `grep -Fc` returns `1`. It is disjoint from the two strings `R17_v87_warmup_resolution.md` searches on the same line. Verify once more before applying, as a matter of routine.

## What must not be done with this candidate

**This candidate opens no register entry and must not acquire one.** Preamble §S8 admits a clarification of a true but incomplete formulation into this directory on the explicit condition that it carries none. The claim survives its own falsification rule on both columns and in both campaigns; what is added is the basis on which it survives.

**It must not be merged with `R17_v87_warmup_resolution.md`.** That candidate reports the resolution of the two numerals L341 prints. Attaching a scope clarification to a resolution statement makes the reason for each unreadable.

**No revision may present the `γ_lev = 0.28` column as a robustness check the manuscript performed.** L341 makes no leverage-conditional statement, and `protocol_3d`'s second column is not cited anywhere in v87. It is reported here because the sweep produced it, not because the sentence claims it.

**No revision may quote the regenerated numerals in place of the submitted ones without the register entry that carries them.** Their displacement is the R17 campaign-redraw entry of `docs/DEVIATIONS.md`, Class A / D2, and the numeral edits belong to that entry and not to this clarification.
