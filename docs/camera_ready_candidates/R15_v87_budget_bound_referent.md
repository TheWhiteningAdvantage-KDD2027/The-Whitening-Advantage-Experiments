# Camera-Ready Candidate: R15_v87_budget_bound_referent

- **Status:** PARKED — do not apply
- **Trigger:** Acceptance notification of 14 November 2026
- **Register entry:** NO DEVIATION — clarification only

**Target file: `articleB_whitening_v87.tex`**

**Why this is not applied now.** The manuscript is under review and cannot be edited. The deviation inventory is not closed.

**What is being clarified.** The caption says the realized budget reduction is "bounded by the effective panel size `K_eff \approx 1/\hat\rho \approx 3.8`". Panel B of the figure draws a different curve as its reference: the delivered plotting code, line 381, plots `np.sqrt(df_a['K_eff_meas'])`. Two candidate ceilings, and the regenerated campaign shows that only one of them is a ceiling.

**The measurement.**

| quantity                                             | value at `K = 97` |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `K_eff_meas`                                          | `3.7370`          |
| `sqrt(K_eff_meas)`                                    | `1.9331`          |
| realized `budget_reduction`, `c = 0.25`, mean `K >= 20` | `2.0299`          |

Over the ten plotted cells at `c = 0.25`, the realized reduction **exceeds** `sqrt(K_eff)` at six of them (`K = 20, 30, 50, 60, 75, 97`) and **never** exceeds `K_eff` — zero of ten. The caption's literal statement therefore holds; the reference line the figure actually draws does not bound the curve it is drawn beside. On the submitted campaign the picture is the same in kind: plateau `2.0086` against `sqrt(K_eff) = 1.9331`.

**Why the two are not interchangeable, and why neither is an error.** `sqrt(K_eff)` is the natural scale for a *detection-delay ratio* under a fixed drift, because a CUSUM delay falls like the inverse squared signal-to-noise; `K_eff` is the ceiling on the *information* pooling recovers. The delivered figure plots the first as the commensurable comparator and the caption states the second as the bound. Both are defensible; they are simply not the same line, and a reader who matches the caption's `3.8` to the black dotted curve at `1.93` will conclude the figure contradicts its own caption. The regenerated Figure 17 draws **both**, which removes the ambiguity without changing either claim.

**A second, smaller referent slip in the same clause.** L376 reads "saturates the effective panel near `1/\hat\rho \approx 3.8`". `1/\hat\rho` on this campaign is `3.8314`, which does round to `3.8`; the **measured** effective panel size at `K = 97` is `K_eff_meas = 3.7370`, which rounds to `3.7`. The two are different quantities — `1/\rho` is the `K \to \infty` limit of `K/(1 + (K-1)\rho)` and `K_eff` is its value at a finite `K` — and the gap between them is the finite-panel term, not a discrepancy. The caption's `\approx` covers it. It is recorded here so that a camera-ready that wants to print a measured `K_eff` knows the numeral is `3.7`, not `3.8`.

## Edit 1 — Figure 17 caption, name the reference line the figure draws

**Verification of the search string.** The block below is quoted from `articleB_whitening_v87.tex` verbatim and occurs **exactly once** in the file (`grep -Fc` returns `1`). It is disjoint from the strings the two sibling candidates search.

## What must not be done with this candidate

**Do not delete the `sqrt(K_eff)` line from the figure.** It is the comparator commensurable with a ratio of delays and it is the delivered script's own choice. What was missing is its name in the caption, not the line.

**Do not restate the caption's bound as `sqrt(K_eff)`.** That would convert a true statement into a false one: the realized reduction exceeds `sqrt(K_eff)` at six of ten plotted cells.

**Do not read "exceeds `sqrt(K_eff)`" as evidence of a super-efficient escape.** The plateau is `2.03` with a delta-method standard error of `0.0499` propagated from design-corrected SEMs, on seven cells drawn from one panel of 97 assets; it sits between the two candidate ceilings and far below `K_eff`. The claim L376 makes — a real but small escape, a measured `2x` — is what the number supports, and nothing more.
