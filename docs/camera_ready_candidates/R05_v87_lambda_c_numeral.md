**Why this is not applied now.** The manuscript is under review and cannot be edited. The deviation inventory is incomplete: streams R06 onwards may touch the same section, and applying a correction before the inventory closes guarantees reapplying it later.

**What is being corrected.** A numeral, not a claim. The submitted text states that the Concept CUSUM was "fixed once and for all, lambda_C = 10, delta_C = 0.1". Read in float_precision='round_trip', the numeral 10 matches no campaign of the submitted study:

| Campaign | mon_len | lambda_star_Concept | realised FPR |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| protocol_17a (abrupt, Figure 5A) | 5,000 | **10.8** | 0.095 |
| protocol_18b 2e5 (ramps, Figure 5B) | 200,000 | **15.81** | 0.0525 |
| protocol_18b 3e6 (ramps, Appendix B boundary) | 3,000,000 | **19.02** | 0.055 |
| protocol_18a (retired before submission) | — | **13.6** | 0.030 |

The threshold was calibrated per horizon, exactly as the Data arm's lambda_iid_H was (129.48 at H = 2e5, 303.02 at H = 3e6). delta_C = 0.1 is correct and is not touched.

**The substance of the sentence is exact and must be preserved.** lambda_star_Concept is rigorously constant within each campaign: one value across the thirteen penalties of the abrupt grid, one across the sixty rows of the 2e5 ramp grid, one across the eighty-five rows of the 3e6 grid, while lambda_star_Data runs from 43.9 to 847.7 on the same rows. "Fixed once and for all" is true in the sense that carries Proposition prop:orthogonality: the Concept threshold requires no recalibration in Gamma, where the Data arm requires one of a factor of nineteen. Only the numeral is wrong, and it should be replaced rather than removed.

**A second observation, in the manuscript's favour.** Correcting the seed derivation to 128-bit entropy moves the regenerated abrupt-campaign threshold to lambda_star_Concept = 11.4, which is precisely the value v87 names elsewhere, in the paragraph "What exact means here": "the levels bracketing 5% are 5.03% at lambda = 11.2 and 4.29% at lambda = 11.4; we take the nearest attainable level at or below nominal, lambda_star = 11.4." The submitted campaign's 10.8 was inconsistent with the manuscript's own attainable-level analysis; the corrected campaign is not. The realised hold-out level moves from 9.5% to 5.5% accordingly. This is an argument for the correction, not against the paper.

**Verification of the search string.** Unlike the R03 candidate, the frozen .tex was available to the run that produced this file, and the block below is quoted from articleB_whitening_v87.tex line 270 verbatim. No reconstruction was needed. Verify once more before applying, as a matter of routine.

**If a fuller correction is wanted**, the Appendix B sentence that reports the ramp campaigns could carry the two remaining values, since it is the passage where the horizon dependence is already the subject. That is a second, independent edit and is deliberately not bundled here: the block above is the minimum that removes a false numeral without touching a claim.
