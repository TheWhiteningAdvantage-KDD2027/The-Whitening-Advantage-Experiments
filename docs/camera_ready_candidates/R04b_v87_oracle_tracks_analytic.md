**Why this is not applied now.** The manuscript is under review and cannot be edited. The
KDD 2027 Research Track allocates one additional content page to accepted papers for exactly
this kind of revision, so budget is not the constraint; timing is.

**What is being corrected.** The original text states that the oracle arm crosses "on the analytic prediction". While it crosses near the analytic root, it does not track the prediction; it exhibits a systematic $+5\%$ offset across all twelve grid points. The text is amended to reflect the actual mechanism of intersection.
