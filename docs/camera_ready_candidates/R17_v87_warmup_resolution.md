**Why this is not applied now.** The manuscript is under review and cannot be edited.

**Nothing here is false.** `9.5 %` is exactly what the submitted campaign measured, and `3`–`8 %` is exactly the span of its four sign-arm cells. What the sentence omits is the sample behind each: both are read on **200 streams per cell**, which fixes their resolution at half a point and makes the envelope a min–max over four readings rather than a range with a sampling distribution of its own.

**The resolution of `9.5 %`.** `__main__` passes `n_str = 200` to `protocol_3d_warmup_sensitivity` (`Priorite_6_econometric_baseline.py` l.515), so the rate can only take the values `k/200`. The numeral `9.5 %` is `19/200`, and it is the only value in the neighbourhood the design can produce: the lattice runs `9.0 %`, `9.5 %`, `10.0 %`. Its 95 % Wilson interval at that count is **`[6.2 %, 14.4 %]`**, which contains the `5 %` nominal level as well as the `3.0 %` the same sentence quotes at `n = 500`. The interval is what "nearly doubles" is measured against; the point is what the sentence prints.

**The `3`–`8 %` envelope is an extremum over a grid.** `protocol_3d` reports eight cells, and its sign column takes four values across them: `7.5 %`, `3.0 %`, `5.5 %`, `8.0 %` in the submitted campaign. Preamble §S4bis's fourth corollary is explicit that a min or a max over `m` points is an extremum statistic with no stable sampling distribution, and reading four 95 % cell intervals as one simultaneous statement would trigger with probability `1 − 0.95⁴ = 18.6 %` under its own null. The regenerated campaign carries the envelope with a paired stream bootstrap over the 200 stream indices — `[5.5 %, 13.0 %]` around its minimum and `[7.5 %, 15.5 %]` around its maximum — and gates nothing on it. **The invariance the sentence asserts is tested instead by a statistic that has a distribution:** a weighted least-squares slope of the rate on `log(n_warmup)`, binomial weights at 200 streams, whose paired-bootstrap interval `[−0.0153, +0.0195]` covers zero at `p = 0.84`.

**The eight cells hold four readings, not eight.** `simulate_gjr11` draws its whole innovation vector before the variance recursion and every conditional variance is strictly positive, so `sign(ε_t) = sign(z_t)` exactly and the monitored binary stream carries no process parameter. The two `gamma_lev` of a warm-up length therefore read the **same** stream — the regenerated campaign asserts it by SHA-256 — and the submitted campaign exhibits the same identity in its own table: `FPR_ML` is equal at the two leverage settings for every warm-up length (`0.075/0.075`, `0.030/0.030`, `0.055/0.055`, `0.080/0.080`). A mean over the eight cells carries a Kish design effect of exactly `2.0`.

## Edit 1 — `sec:misspecification` L341, give the false-alarm numeral its resolution

**Verification of the search string.** Quoted from **line 341** verbatim; `grep -Fc` returns `1`, and it is disjoint from Edit 2 and from the string `R17_v87_warmup_restoration_scope.md` searches on the same line.

## What must not be done with this candidate

**This candidate opens no register entry and must not acquire one.** The resolution statement contradicts nothing printed: it names the sample behind two numerals the sentence gives without one. Preamble §S8 admits exactly this kind of clarification on the condition that it carries no register row, and the displacement of the numerals themselves is a separate matter carried by the R17 campaign-redraw entry of `docs/DEVIATIONS.md`.

**The envelope must not be re-presented as an interval.** A min–max over four cells is not a confidence statement, and substituting a bootstrap envelope for the printed range would replace one descriptive object by another without saying which is which. If a revision wants an inferential statement about warm-up independence, the slope and its interval are the object to quote, not the extrema.

**No revision may claim the four cells are four independent measurements.** They are read on the same 200 streams over evaluation windows that overlap by 65 % to 95 %, which is why the envelope and the slope both carry a **paired** bootstrap over stream indices and not a binomial one.
